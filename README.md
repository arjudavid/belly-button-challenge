# belly-button-challenge

The HTML has the intial code that was provide by edX. I just added one last line that extracts the bar info from a json with the code into the HTML.

The json code is commented and runs without errors. 

Here's the link from git hub pages: https://arjudavid.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

1.-I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

2.- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3.- Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4.- Displayed the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5.- Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. 

6.- Deployed the app to a free static page hosting service (GitHub Pages).
